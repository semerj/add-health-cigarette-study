We examined three substance use behaviors: daily smoking, past-month marijuana use, and regular HED. Smoking was assessed as days smoked out of the past 30 days; this was dichotomized to indicate whether individuals smoked on all of the past 30 days. Marijuana use was assessed as times used during the past month; this was dichotomized into any/no past month marijuana use. Frequency of HED (WaveI–III definition: 5+ drinks; Wave IV definition: 4+ drinks for females, 5+ drinks formales) during the past year was assessed; this was dichotomized into any/no regular past year HED, where regular HED was defined as at least one time per month for the past 12 months
